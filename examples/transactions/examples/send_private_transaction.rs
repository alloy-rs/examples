//! Example of sending a private transaction using Flashbots Protect.

    // By default, Flashbots Protect transactions are only shared with the Flashbots Builder, which
    // builds only a subset of all Ethereum blocks. In `fast` mode, transactions are shared with
    // all registered builders no less than one block after they are received to increase the
    // number of blocks the user's transaction can be included in.
    //
    // Fast mode has 2 key differences from the default Protect experience:
    // - Shared with all builders: By default, Flashbots Protect transactions are only shared with
    //   the Flashbots Builder, which builds only a subset of all Ethereum blocks. In fast mode,
    //   transactions are shared with all registered builders no less than one block after they are
    //   received to increase the number of blocks the user's transaction can be included in.
    // - Larger refund paid to validator: By default, only 10% of MEV-Share refunds are paid to
    //   validators. In fast mode, validators receive 50% of refunds which makes it more likely that
    //   the userâ€™s transactions will be chosen in a given block.
    //
    // For more information, see the [Flashbots documentation](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview).
    //
    // To use `fast` mode change the URL to `https://rpc.flashbots.net/fast`.

    // Build the transaction using the `EthereumSigner` with the provided signer.
    // Flashbots Protect requires the transaction to be signed locally and send using
    // `eth_sendRawTransaction`.
    let tx_envelope = tx.build(&EthereumSigner::from(signer)).await?;

    // Encode the transaction using EIP-2718 encoding.

    // Send the raw transaction. The transaction is sent to the Flashbots relay and, if valid, will

    // is invalid and will not be included in the blockchain.
