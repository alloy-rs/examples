/// In Ethereum, the nonce of a transaction is a number that represents the number of transactions
/// that have been sent from a particular account. The nonce is used to ensure that transactions are
/// processed in the order they are intended, and to prevent the same transaction from being
/// processed multiple times.
///
/// The nonce manager in Alloy is a layer that helps you manage the nonce
/// of transactions by keeping track of the current nonce for a given account and automatically
/// incrementing it as needed. This can be useful if you want to ensure that transactions are sent
/// in the correct order, or if you want to avoid having to manually manage the nonce yourself.
